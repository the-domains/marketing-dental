### To Pay Or Not To Pay For Online Marketing

One of the questions I regularly get asked is when should I "pay" for online marketing. When should I physically get out my credit card and pay for online marketing or can I essentially do it for free?

This is a really valid question as you can have success with both paid and "free" and of course a combination of the two and that is the subject of this week's video blog.

#### Is It Really Free?

First of all it's a good idea to explore the notion of "free marketing." I would argue that there is no such thing as free marketing. There is marketing where you don't physically pay, but this tends to take time and time, if you run a business, of course costs money.

However, we all know that when you start a small business you often have to do most things yourself and this would more than likely be one of them.

So today's video explores the options of paid vs unpaid. We'll look at unpaid such as blogging, social media content, interacting with other businesses as well as paid such as pay per click advertising with Google Adwords or paid Facebook advertising. We'll also look at return on investment and how much you should be spending on marketing to secure a client.

Take a look at the video and tell us what you think.
