We all need regular and ongoing patients to keep our business going, looking after them is the cornerstone to any good dental practice. Come to think of it, this is the case in any business.

Yet any practice will naturally have a degree of turnover so acquiring new patients is a necessity.  The problem is how much should you spend on doing this? Is it worth spending £100, £1000 -  how can you tell. 

Well the easy answer to this is actually a question, what is the average lifetime value of a patient? How much does an average patient spend in your practice each month, year, every five years. 

Okay this is going to vary, if someone pays for Invisalign they are going to be worth more than someone who doesn't! A child's dental care will be less than an adults, what about NHS vs private. 

Have a look at your total books over the last 3-5 years, take a look at typical patterns of behaviour. Then look at average spend and average patient lifetime. 

This will give you a figure and from that you can work out what to spend on marketing. If a patient is worth £5000 throughout their lifetime with you, surely you can spend £200 on acquiring one!
