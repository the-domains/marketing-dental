Did you know that more than 70% of the UK population are on Facebook? Did you also know that of those 70% approximately 75% access it daily? So in other words most of the UK population over 13 are using it, and yet, just as with other forms of social media, many organisations and businesses question the value of it's use. 

Let's be absolutely clear -  every dental practice should be using social media!

You see a dentist's work is pretty visible, and social media loves visual images. Demonstrating the value and skills of your work is a great way of building trust and attracting new patients. 

Not only that, you can be very specific about who you target and interact with. This can be based on location, age, relationship status etc. so social media offers a great range of options when it comes to dental marketing
